**Notes**

Solutions were written primarily in both Java and Scala, even on the days when Scala was not an available option on HackerRank's online code editor.

Some of the daily solutions were written in Python as well.

The only solution written in all 4 languages (C++, Java, Python, and Scala) was for Day 21, which covered the subject of generics.

See the `problem_instructions.txt` file for detailed problem descriptions (with instructions) for each day of the contest.
